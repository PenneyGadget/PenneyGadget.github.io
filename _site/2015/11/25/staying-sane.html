<h3 class="post-title">Staying Sane</h3>
<div class="blog-post">
  <p>Being a student at Turing is no joke. To put it not-so-politely, it's fucking hard as shit. In order to stay sane, there are a few key things
  that I've needed to make sure I keep in my life, despite feeling like there's not enough time for anything, ever.<br>I have to make sure I get
  enough sleep and that I eat my healthiest diet (which for me is modified Paleo). I am utilizing my training in clinical herbalism and making sure
  to drink lots of nutritive teas full of herbs that help the body deal with stress (more in depth discussion of that topic to come!).
  But by far the most important thing I do to keep myself happy and healthy is to get exercise - and for me that mainly means rock climbing.
  Climbing makes me feel happier than any other form of activity I've ever done. I've never been able to focus enough to properly meditate, but I've
  found that the act of climbing removes every other concern present in my life and brings me utterly and completely into the moment.
  It is the most zen activity I've ever experienced.<br> On top of that I find that the physical effect it has on my system is incredible. It
  not only makes me feel completely stretched out like yoga, but also has the ability to literally "flush-out" my stress, tiredness, and depression.
  If I'm feeling bad or gross and I go climbing and push myself hard, I can actually feel my body clear out those feelings, both physically and
  mentally.<br>Climb on!!</p>
