<h3 class="post-title">Staying Sane</h3>
<div class="blog-post">
  <p>
    I am currently a more-than-full-time student at Turing School of Software
    and Design studying full-stack web development and it is no joke. To put it
    not-so-politely, it's really fucking hard. Not only am I putting in around
    40 hours a week of required classs time, we also constantly have homework
    and big projects, making 60, 70, 80+ hour weeks.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to stay sane, there are a few key things that I've needed to make
    sure I keep in my life, despite feeling like there's not enough time for
    anything, ever. I have to make sure I get enough sleep and that I eat my
    healthiest diet. I find myself utilizing my training in clinical herbalism
    more now than ever, making sure to drink lots of nutritive teas full of herbs
    that help the body adapt to stress. But by far the most important thing I do
    to keep myself happy and healthy is to get exercise - and for me that mainly
    means rock climbing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Climbing makes me feel happier than any other form of activity I've ever
    done. I've never been able to focus enough to properly meditate, but I've
    found that the act of climbing removes every other concern present in my
    life and brings me utterly and completely into the moment. It is the most
    zen activity I've ever experienced. On top of that I find that the physical
    effect it has on my system is incredible. It not only makes me feel completely
    stretched out, but also has the ability to literally "flush-out" my stress,
    tiredness, and depression. If I'm feeling bad or gross and I go climbing, I
    can actually feel my body clear out those feelings, both physically and mentally.
  </p>
  <p>
    Perhaps the single most important discipline I've had to cultivate while a
    student at Turing is time management. And I don't mean normal-people time
    management -- I mean ninja time management. Diamond thief time management.
    Knowing how and why and when to walk away and take a break is crucial to
    staying sane in this program. We are even given a lecture on "managing your
    shit" right at the beginning of the program, because that's how important
    it is. If you don't get enough sleep, your brain doesn't function as well.
    If you don't eat well and regularly, your brain doesn't funciton as well.
    And yes, if you don't get enough exercise... you guessed it: your brain
    doesn't function as well. So despite constantly feeling like I'm behind and
    not doing enough - I have to remeber to take care of Numero Uno (moi) in
    order to be my best and most present self.
