    My life has changed in such a dramatic way in the last few months. If my 20-something-year-old self had told my now 30-something-year-old
    self that this is what I'd be doing I would undoubtedly have laughed, scoffed, and rolled my eyes. How does an individual who tried so hard
    to live off grid on a farm end up in web development school? <br> To be sure I've had some moments of identity crisis... <br>
    But I've come to realize that this path isn't all that strange for me really.
    It brings together a lot of things that I enjoy - art, design, puzzles, math - and is giving me one hell of a challenge - something
    I hate and crave all at the same time. On top of that, I believe that this career path will allow me the financial security and freedom I've
    always dreamed of. When I really think about why I've done so many different things in my life it's because all I've every really wanted
    is to see the world and all
    it has to offer - at my core I am the epitomy of wanderlust. But I have grown weary of doing all those things on other peoples terms. I have
    poured my heart and soul into other peoples homes, plants, animals, <em>lives</em>.<br>So now I'm ready to make things happen in my own life, for <em>me</em>.
    <br>This is the first step on the path to my new life and, despite strugglign and being terrified, I also couldn't be more excited.
