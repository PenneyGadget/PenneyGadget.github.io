    Well if I've learned anything in these months of web development school, it's that this shit is harder
    than I anticipated. In the interest of helping all these difficult concepts sink in a bit better, I am
    going to revisit and write about some of them.<br>
    Today's topic? CRUD!<br>
    Ewww, what's CRUD? That doesn't sound like something you want anywhere near your computer!<br>
    CRUD stands for Create, Read (or sometimes Retrieve), Update, and Destroy. These are the four basic
    functions of persistant storage. CRUD provides everything we need to manage the flow of data through
    and within a database. Differest users interacting with a database may have different CRUD cycles
    based on their authorizations - for example, a regular user may not be able to delete or update
    anything on a website, whereas an admin can.<br>
    So what does this look like in practice?<br>
