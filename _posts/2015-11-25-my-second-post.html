  <p>Being a student at Turing is no joke. To put it politely, it's fucking hard as shit. In order to stay sane, there are a few key things
  that I've needed to make sure I keep in my life, despite feeling like there's not enough time for anything, ever. <br>I have to make sure I get
  enough sleep and that I eat my healthiest diet. I am utilizing my training in clinical herbalism, making sure to drink lots of nutritive
  teas full of herbs that help the body deal with stress (more in depth discussion of that topic to come!). But by far the most important
  thing I do to keep myself happy and healthy is to get exercise - and for me that means rock climbing. Climbing makes me feel happier than
  any other form of activity I've ever done. I've never been able to focus enough to properly meditate, but being on the wall removes every
  other concern present in my life and I am utterly and completely in the moment.<br>I'm totally going to write more here later but I have to
  turn in this project so that I can get on a plane in the morning to.... go climb in Arizona for the weekend!!</p>
