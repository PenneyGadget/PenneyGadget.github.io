    Penney has an eclectic background that spans the globe and includes things
    like organic farming, goat tending, almond and olive harvesting, international
    art residencies, clinical herbalism and nutrition training, rock climbing,
    brewing and fermenting, mushroom hunting, personal chefing, and other general oddities.

    Her most recent endeavor involved being a more-than-full-time student at the
    <a href="http://turing.io/">Turing School of Software and Design</a>, studying 
    something weird they call "full stack web development". It was by far the
    strangest and most difficult thing she has done thus far. But now she's a
    real developer(!), gaining more knowledge by the day and eager to see where
    this new path takes her.
